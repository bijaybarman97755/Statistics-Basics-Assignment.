        "  . The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the probability of obtaining a certain number of \"successes\" in a fixed number of independent trials. To use the binomial distribution, several conditions must be met:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Fixed Number of Trials (n):\n",
        "\n",
        " - The experiment must consist of a fixed number of trials. You must know in advance how many times the experiment will be repeated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Independent Trials:\n",
        "\n",
        " - The outcome of each trial must be independent of the outcomes of the other trials. This means that the result of one trial does not affect the result of any other trial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Two Possible Outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Each trial must have only two possible outcomes, often referred to as \"success\" and \"failure.\" These outcomes must be mutually exclusive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Constant Probability of Success (p):\n",
        "\n",
        " - The probability of \"success\" (p) must remain constant from trial to trial. The probability of \"failure\" (1 - p) must also remain constant.\n",
        "\n",
        " - In essence, the binomial distribution is applicable when you're dealing with a situation where you're counting the number of times a specific event occurs in a set number of attempts, and each attempt has the same chance of that event happening.\n",

        "  . The normal distribution, also known as the Gaussian distribution or bell curve, is a fundamental concept in statistics. It's a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean.\n",

        "Properties of the Normal Distribution:\n",

        "\n",
        " - Mean, Median, and Mode are Equal: In a perfect normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same value, located at the center of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Total Area Under the Curve is 1: The total area under the normal curve represents the total probability of all possible outcomes, which is equal to 1 (or 100%).\n",
        "\n",
        " - Asymptotic Tails: The tails of the normal curve extend infinitely in both directions, approaching the horizontal axis but never touching it.\n",
        "  \n",
        " - Defined by Mean (μ) and Standard Deviation (σ): The shape and position of the normal distribution are completely determined by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ). The mean determines the center of the distribution, and the standard deviation determines the spread or width of the curve.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Continuous Distribution: The normal distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that the variable can take on any value within a given range.\n",

        "\n",
        " - The empirical rule, also known as the 68-95-99.7 rule, provides a quick way to understand the spread of data in a normal distribution. It states that:\n",
        "\n",
        " - 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean: Approximately 68% of the data values lie between μ - σ and μ + σ.\n",
        "\n",
        " - 95% of the data falls within two standard deviations of the mean: Approximately 95% of the data values lie between μ - 2σ and μ + 2σ.\n",
        "\n",
        " - 99.7% of the data falls within three standard deviations of the mean: Approximately 99.7% of the data values lie between μ - 3σ and μ + 3σ.\n",
        "\n",
        "Significance of the Empirical Rule:\n",
        "\n",
        " - It provides a simple way to estimate the proportion of data within certain ranges in a normal distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        " - It helps identify potential outliers, as values outside of three standard deviations are relatively rare.\n",
